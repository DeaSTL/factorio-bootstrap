# Factorio Bootstrap Script


### Disclaimer
This is only for linux, i've only tested it on a debian based distro
so good luck with other ones ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


### Setup
Start choosing your specific factorio version you would like to use in the `config.sh` then run `./update.sh`

This will download headless factorio and set it up in the current directory

__if you have a exiting save then place it in `saves/` directory__

### Running the server

Simply run `./start.sh` preferably in [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)  or some some terminal multiplexer so you can later view the console
